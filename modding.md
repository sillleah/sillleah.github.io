Here is my collection of modding tutorials for Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights.  
These are currently a work-in-progress with mostly only text guides, but the ultimate end goal is to have both text and video versions available of every guide.  
Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord if you have questions or issues.

If you aren't sure where to start, I'd recommend working through these tutorials in the order they're listed below. Once you have the basics down, don't be afraid to jump around to focus on things that interest you most.

These guides are intended for the Gamecube version of the game. I am not experienced enough with other versions of the game to provide modding support.
