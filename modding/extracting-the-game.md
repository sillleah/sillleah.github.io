So you'd like to mod Night of 100 Frights, eh?  
Well, you can, and I'm here to help!

As with any game, the first step before we can start modding the game is to have the game files, extracted and ready for modification, as well as a way to edit them.  
This tutorial will walk you through extracting the game files and setting up a basic, tidy modding environment.

## The ISO

First things first, you will need a Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights Gamecube ISO. It is not legal to distribute ISO files over the internet, so I cannot provide you with an ISO or information on where to find one.

## Preparing Dolphin

Dolphin Emulator is the easiest way to extract the game files from the ISO. You likely already have it, since it's also the easiest way to test and play your game and mods, but you can download it [here](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/?ref=btn) if not.

Open up Dolphin Emulator. If this is your first time opening the emulator, you won't have a games directory set and Dolphin will prompt you to set one, as shown below.
