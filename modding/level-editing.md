[Back to Modding Tutorials](https://sillleah.github.io/modding.html)

This is the first tutorial that will guide you through actually editing levels in Industrial Park.
Making level edits opens up a lot of potential to create unique modded experiences, or to just fill Mystery 1 with crabs if that's something you're interested in.

Before we can get to the fun stuff, though, we need to cover the basics of making changes to objects in Industrial Park.
If you need a refresher on viewing levels in Industrial Park and selecting objects in the editor, refer back to the [Basics of Industrial Park](https://sillleah.github.io/modding/industrial-park.html) and [Using the Editor](https://sillleah.github.io/modding/editor.html) tutorials.

## Deleting an Object

Let's start with something simple. We're going to delete an object from the level entirely.
You can use any level and object you like, but I'm going to be deleting the Hedge Key from 'The Mystery Machine: Part 1' in this example.

First, adjust the camera as necessary and then select the object in the level by clicking on it.

Then, simply press DEL on your keyboard.
Alternatively, you can right-click on the selected object in the Archive Editor Window and select 'Remove'.

(Side note: Be careful which objects you delete - if you delete an object that another object in the level relies on to function, you might cause the game to crash. (For example, if you were to delete the text object displayed by a clue.)

## Moving an Object

Now let's cover how to move objects.
When you select an object in Industrial Park, three arrows will appear around it - one red, one blue, and one green.
You can click on these arrows and drag to move an object along that axis.
