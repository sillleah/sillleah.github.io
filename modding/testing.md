This simple tutorial will show you three ways of easily launching an extracted modded game.

## Method 1: Through Industrial Park

This is the simplest and most important way to launch a modded game.  
Inside of Industrial Park, on the top bar, navigate to Tools > Run Game.  
You should be prompted to choose a program to open the game in. Click 'Choose another app' or the equivalent, and then find and select Dolphin.exe from your Dolphin installation. Done! You shouldn't need to find Dolphin again when running the game in the future.

## Method 2: In File Explorer

Open your extracted files 'sys' folder and open main.dol.  
Just as with Method 1, you'll be prompted to choose a program (if you haven't already), choose Dolphin.

## Method 3: Inside Dolphin

If for whatever reason, you want to add your extracted game to Dolphin's game list, you can do so rather easily.
At the top of Dolphin, open Config > Paths and add a new path, just as explained in the [Extracting the Game](https://sillleah.github.io/modding/extracting-the-game.html) tutorial.
When prompted to choose a folder, choose your 'sys' folder.
A new copy of Night of 100 Frights should now appear in your Dolphin game list, notably 0 bytes in size. (Don't worry, it'll work fine.)
You can launch this to test your modded game.

One more thing - always remember to Save All Open HIPs in Industrial Park before you test!!!

Congratulations - you've completed the basics of preparing to mod the game. Now you can more freely move on to tutorials that show you how to actually begin making changes with the knowledge given to you - but I recommend next, you move on to the Simple Level Editing tutorial, which will cover actually modifying objects in a level!
